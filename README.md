# NETWORKS-AND-SYSTEMS-ADMINISTRATION-B9IS121
This is a project for the networks and systems Administration (B9IS121) BY VIRENDER KUMAR (10594417)

Working with Cisco packet tracer for the network design and implementation of the network. The Goal of the project to design a stable network for a multinational organization. We implemented the network into 3 different locations for the network based as Dublin, India and UK (where all the servers are placed). We used ospf routing protocol to provide the routing solution for the organization. We have deployed centralized servers like DHCP,DNS,WEB server along with a new network controller. For network troubleshooting and maintenance we enabled SSH and TELNET over all network routers and switches. We also implemented the added security by blocking ICMP traffic to all the servers.
